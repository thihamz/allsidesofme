            </div>
            <div class="curatorialBody">
                All Sides of Me is an encounter with material and meaning, exploring aspects of personhood and the
                complex,
                ever-evolving biological and digital systems that inform our views of self. We all see the world through
                individual experience, spatial, social, political and conceptual. We can discover new realities and
                memories
                once we acknowledge the importance of varied and diverse engagement, this being a driver in how we
                navigate
                our environment. Before technology, measures of pleasurability were aligned with significant
                non-technological sensory experiences, such as new tastes, smells, visual stimulus and experiences with
                touch. Looking at the importance of sensory encounters allows for accessible experience, in particular
                being
                inclusive of the diversity of different ways to observe.
                <br><br>
                Being a part of natural and transformative spaces allows for the exploration of interspecies
                relationships
                as well, and the collaborations of human and non-human life forms through the absence of language. Most
                of
                nature communicates in exchange of scent, and chemical production/ release, creating an alternative
                sensual
                landscape to what we perceive through a human centred lens.
                <br><br>
                Other parts of experience are represented in landscape and place, and how this helps examine the
                biographies
                of a person, inclusive of their environmental experiences outside of themselves. When people find
                themselves
                reflected within specific communities, places, aesthetics, movements, tastes, and scents, it influences
                what
                they see in other objects, and spaces. The interpretations of senses change depending on what surrounds
                them, and calls into question their underlying associations; these associations merge as part of the
                spectator’s past, present and future.
                <br><br>
                We encourage all visitors to engage with the work presented, through any way that feels comfortable and
                rewarding, we hope that within this exhibition there is something that feels representative of you, your
                interests and the plentiful and various sides of yourself.

                    Magali Mendez is a biodesigner and researcher interested in
                    incorporating biological living systems principles into her designs.
                    With a product design background, she discovered her passion
                    for sustainable design after questioning the environmental impact
                    of traditional manufacturing. Magali was exposed to this industry

                    Beverley Duckworth is a visual artist based in London. Working with durational sculpture
                    and installation, her practice traverses socially constructed boundaries defining bodies and
                    the environment. She reveals and reconfigures the discarded to create transient, living
                    works that require an ongoing process of tending and mending. Beverley was shortlisted for
                    the International Mother Art Prize 2020 and the Sustainability First Art Award 2022, and was
                    a selected artist for UK New Artists City Takeover 2022. She has exhibited widely in the UK
                    and internationally.

                    insidious socio-cultural doctrine could be achieved by the political and military classes.

                    Sound is a fundamental aspect of the world we live in, as everything vibrates and emits frequencies.
                    Scientific research has shown that sound frequencies can influence our cells and their functions on
                    a cellular level. In today’s world, the sounds we hear are mostly artificial and often overpower
                    natural sounds. Despite being invisible to the human eye, man-made soundwaves have significant
                    effects on both the micro and macroscopic levels of our organisms.
                    <br>
                    What if we could use sound frequencies to engineer material growth that could help counteract these
                    effects?
                    <br>
                    Enter Soundwall, an acoustic project that combines designer expertise with biology, physics and
                    arts. The project involves growing soundproofing tiles made from fast-growing and carbon-hungry
                    grass seeds, creating a high-density root foam material that absorbs mid to high-frequency ranges of
                    sound. The resulting wall of tiles is designed with patterns that represent the frequencies of the
                    audible sounds that surround us.
                    <br>
                    Soundwall challenges our current production system by bringing back nature and designer
                    'savoir-faire' at the center of our economic system, creating regenerative and acoustic solutions
                    for indoor architecture. By exposing the invisible world of soundwaves, Soundwall inspires new ways
                    of using frequencies for positive impact, creating hope for a more sustainable future.

                    I’ve consistently obsessed over so many subjects in the past when it comes to my art: from
                    technology to nature, philosophy to religion, and cooking to gardening. I tend to imagine parallel
                    worlds or outer space, but where our variation of reality would still exist in these alienated
                    spaces. Trying to understand species other than homo sapiens: their biologies, working mechanisms,
                    and systems. Fundamental physical and metaphorical elements taken from ancient wisdom, such as
                    Confucianism, bagua, medicine, mathematics, horoscopes, and astrophysics. Viewing or relating our
                    species's evolution, revolution, or development, from looking at the past and attempting to
                    calculate the future. I’ve attempted to befriend and understand nature by finding ways to connect to
                    the original source of energy for all living/non-living things that are currently cohabiting on the
                    planet. Where a lot of my work is time durational and collaborates with other life forms, in which
                    they have their own freedom and consciousness for their own chosen direction. My practice is
                    undergoing a constant metamorphosis, where stimulating chaotic thoughts enrich my work with deeper,
                    funny connections and understandings.I like to think of the 'functioning' worlds or systems I forge
                    with each work, the fiction I weave, and how idiosyncrasies engage with the fantastical. There are
                    no determined starting or ending points in what I make, as I want the experiences to be carried on
                    by whoever comes across them, by any life forms.

                    Not restricted to a single medium, Hal's practice traverses a multitude of materials, forms and
                    ideas, with the latter consistently being the progenitor of each project. Whether what they make
                    becomes a film, installation, sculpture, piece of clothing, sound, music, story etc. is the result
                    of exploring the concept and seeing where it takes them. While working on a form of opera called
                    Soon You Will Be Bird Feed (2019-present), they began making the instruments on which the music
                    would be written and performed, leading to what is currently an ensemble of guitars, keyed
                    instruments, percussion, flutes and reed instruments, providing the main voices of the opera, as
                    well as the soundtrack to most of their subsequent films.

                    West explores objects and materials within the studio and translates these into the virtual
                    environment resulting in a practice that centres around sculpture and video. The process of creating
                    objects within a virtual space is entirely removed from the hand and would intuitively appear as to
                    be a process that is polarised to the more traditional ways of making that make up a sculptural
                    practice – be it the turning of a bit to create a hole in metal, or the shaving and refining of wood
                    with a plane to flatten and remove signs of it’s natural form.
                    The idea of ‘the machine’ continues as a central theme in his practice. A machine is ultimately an
                    object created to remove man from the need to labour. And so, through its repetitive, unthinking
                    actions this mechanical functioning acquires an apparent purposefulness – it transforms these blind
                    movements into acts of ritual. Parts are created that appear to have purpose but are then repeatedly
                    stacked in way that beguile any useful function. Questioning ideas of purpose and function and
                    exploring the roles of work and labour in our society.

                    Turning to the biological alchemy that supports almost all life on earth, ‘Like a Leaf’ integrates
                    the building blocks of photosynthesis [air, water, and light], as tools for design.
                    <br>
                    Cyanobacteria captures carbon from the atmosphere and transforms it into a binding mineral through
                    the process of photosynthetic biomineralization, creating a living, breathing, carbon-hungry
                    material with enhanced photosynthetic ability.

                    Here material must be treated not like a brick but like a leaf, shifting towards a way of building

                    Kaye Song is a designer who works across installation, drawing and photography to tell stories about
                    places. Combining analogue processes with digital design, the work she makes aims to convey both the
                    physical and emotional complexities of human environments.

                    is an artist whose work seeks to register and erode the artifice of dominion and its underlying
                    ideologies through processes of time, attention and relationship. Travis was a Fellow at Ox-Bow
                    School of Art & Artists' Residency, and has attended residencies at Haystack Mountain School of
                    Crafts and Monson Arts. Travis has exhibited internationally at venues including Haus Wien (Vienna,
                    AT), Warbling (London, UK), Hyde Park Art Center (Chicago, IL), Block Museum of Art, (Evanston, IL),
                    Center for Maine Contemporary Art (Rockland, ME), AS220 (Providence, RI), among others. Travis has a

                    Delia Detritus, is a multi-disciplinary artist exploring her practice through sculpture, sound and
                    spatial engineering. Delia describes herself as “a full time polymath, part time wife” Her work
                    dissects natural elements, behaviours and sensations. It tries to draw lines between marginal
                    experiences and the drudgery of embodiment. It plays tricks on the viewer and seeks to both provide
                    an intimate moment of reflection and unity and a confronting moment of solitude, a place for you to
                    be alone with what you have become and all the things you could be.
