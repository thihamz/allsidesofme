                All Sides of me is an encounter with material and meaning, exploring aspects of personhood and the
                complex,
                ever-evolving biological and digital systems that inform our views of self. We all see the world through
                individual experience, spatial, social, political and conceptual. We can discover new realities and
                memories
                once we acknowledge the importance of varied and diverse engagement, this being a driver in how we
                navigate
                our environment. Before technology, measures of pleasurability were aligned with significant
                non-technological sensory experiences, such as new tastes, smells, visual stimulus and experiences with
                touch. Looking at the importance of sensory encounters allows for accessible experience, in particular
                being
                inclusive of the diversity of different ways to observe.
                <br><br>
                Being a part of natural and transformative spaces allows for the exploration of interspecies
                relationships
                as well, and the collaborations of human and non-human life forms through the absence of language. Most
                of
                nature communicates in exchange of scent, and chemical production/ release, creating an alternative
                sensual
                landscape to what we perceive through a human centred lens.
                <br><br>
                Other parts of experience are represented in landscape and place, and how this helps examine the
                biographies
                of a person, inclusive of their environmental experiences outside of themselves. When people find
                themselves
                reflected within specific communities, places, aesthetics, movements, tastes, and scents, it influences
                what
                they see in other objects, and spaces. The interpretations of senses change depending on what surrounds
                them, and calls into question their underlying associations; these associations merge as part of the
                spectatorâ€™s past, present and future.
                <br><br>
                We encourage all visitors to engage with the work presented, through any way that feels comfortable and
                rewarding, we hope that within this exhibition there is something that feels representative of you, your
                interests and the plentiful and various sides of yourself.
